Mobile phones are one of them and we are using it every day and every time. Ordering food is a one of the most popular application uses by people worldwide.

The name of our application is “SerWe”. It’s an android application that helps the customer to order the food in easiest way possible. As nowadays everyone is busy, so some find tough to travel to the restaurants to get their food and in order to solve this we have come up with an application that makes a lot easier to order food online.\\
Our group is working on food delivery application “SERWE”. Serwe provides two interfaces for the two types of users i.e. two Android mobile applications one for customers and another for restaurant staff members.

People prefer to order food online instead of visiting the restaurants to buy a food, so after reviewing the digital or online market we reached at the conclusion that we will continue to develop this food ordering application. Which will generate great revenue in the future.

We personally do not like waiting for long in the restaurants or to have to call restaurants to place an order especially during the peak lunch or dinner hours. Moreover, we value recent learning about the iOS and Android Programming languages as well as seeing how powerful and dynamic they are when it comes to design and create big applications. The languages used to build this application are Android using Java and xml whereas Firebase database at the backend because We found them to be extremely useful while working on the technologies.

\section{App monetizing }
Online food delivery apps are a major trend these days as plenty of people simply love to place an order for food from the comfort of their own homes.\\
Food delivery in Canada has transitioned from dialing a number, to ordering online to opening an app on your phone. While players have come and gone over the years, these days the industry has mostly consolidated with a handful of big players left.\\



\textbf{The Revenue Model – How The Food Delivery App Makes Money?}\\
There are many ways in which you can monetize your on-demand food delivery mobile application. A few but most commonly applied monetization methods are:\\
\textbf{
1.Delivery Charges}
Many restaurants do not provide home delivery. So when you offer them your on-demand delivery app with food delivery personnel, then the restaurant will most likely pay you delivery charges.The Delivery app made a profit of 164 dollar million last year with this particular revenue model.

 
\\
\textbf{2.Surge Pricing}
Uber Eats implicates a surge price when the demand is too high. In this process, the app limits the menu options and adds a surcharge (peak price) when the customer is placing the order. The rate of demand can be lower, but the per delivery amount can rise to a great extent in this type of revenue model.
 

\textbf{3.Commission}
The food delivery app owner can charge a commission for every order that the customer makes through the app. For generating revenue, companies prefer this revenue model.

This model not only helps in generating high revenues but also helps in creating a long-term relationship between the food delivery app company and the restaurant.

\section{Use Cases}
A use case is a description of a specific interaction between an actor (an entity external to the system, such as a user or another system) and the system being designed.

Use cases add value because they help explain how the system should behave and in the process, they also help brainstorm what could go wrong.  They provide a list of goals and this list can be used to establish the cost and complexity of the system.
Represents the goal of an interaction between an actor and the system. The goal represents a meaningful and measurable objective for the \textbf{actor}. Records a set of paths (scenarios) that traverse an actor from a trigger \textbf{event} (start of the use case) to the \textbf{goal} (success scenarios).
